# Preventing ML Regression: Forgetting-Penalized Training

## The Problem

When you update a machine learning model, you want it to get better—not worse. But standard training often creates regression: the model learns to handle new cases correctly while forgetting how to handle cases it previously got right. This is a major headache when deploying models in production.

Consider a fraud detection system. After an update, it might catch new types of fraud but suddenly start flagging legitimate transactions it used to approve. Users notice when things that worked yesterday don't work today.

## The Solution

Track which validation examples your model gets right over time. When a training update would make the model wrong on examples it was previously correct about, penalize that update.

The math is simple: instead of just minimizing training loss, minimize training loss plus a penalty for "forgetting" validation examples.

```
Total Loss = Training Loss + λ × (Number of Newly-Incorrect Validation Examples)
```

This forces the model to find updates that improve training performance without regressing on validation cases it already handles well.

## Why This Matters

**Smoother learning**: Instead of the model flip-flopping on examples, it learns more consistently.

**Production safety**: Models are less likely to regress on capabilities when updated.

**Interpretable training**: You can see exactly which examples the model "changes its mind" about and why.

**Pareto improvements**: Updates that help some cases without hurting others are prioritized over updates that involve trade-offs.

## Implementation

The system tracks validation example correctness over training steps:
- Step 1: Examples A, B, C correct; D, E wrong
- Step 2: Examples A, B, D correct; C, E wrong  
- Forgetting count: 1 (example C forgotten)

During training, gradients that would increase forgetting are penalized proportionally.

## Testing

We compare standard SGD versus forgetting-penalized SGD on the same data:
- Final accuracy on held-out test set
- Total number of validation examples forgotten during training  
- Smoothness of learning curves
- Computational overhead

The key question: does preventing forgetting lead to better or worse final performance?

## Why It Works

Standard training assumes some forgetting is necessary for generalization. But maybe the model's natural tendency to "change its mind" about examples is often counterproductive. By forcing consistency on validation cases, we might get more robust representations.

This is particularly valuable for production systems where regression on known-good cases is worse than slower progress on new cases.

The approach scales to any model and dataset—you just need to track validation example correctness over time and add the penalty term.
